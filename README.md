# odin-recipes
My recipes project w The Odin Project

I've just completed this project using the terminal the whole time for my coding. It was very 
hard but it helped me learn the commands by memory instead of just copying and pasting the code
via the html-boilerplate template. Honestly I enjoyed working on this as you see it when from 
being a serious thing to getting progressively more of a joke of a recipe website but it's for
practice and coding is supposed to be fun. I enjoyed this as my first Odin Project assignment
can't wait for more."
